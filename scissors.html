<h2>CUTTING PIZZA WITH SCISSORS</h2>

<p>Cutting pizza with scissors is a valid method, particularly for Roman-style pizza or when using scissors with a built-in spatula. It can be more efficient and preserve the crust better than using a pizza wheel, especially for thin, long pizzas or those on a pizza stone</p>

<h2>Method</h2>

<p>1.Using one hand in an oven mitt hold up one side of the pizza.<br>&nbsp<br>2.Using your other hand cut through the pizza using the scissors.<br>&nbsp<br> 3.Repeat for as many slices as you like.</p>
